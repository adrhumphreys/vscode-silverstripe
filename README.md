# VSCODE - SilverStripe
Basically this makes .ss files look good again and adds a few snippets to .ss files and .php files that I found handy.

## Make emmet work

Open `Preferences` -> `Settings`

Add below settings to enable Emmet for .ss files:

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "SilverStripe": "html"
}
```
